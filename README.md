# nix.means.no

Supports 
* my media center / home hub
* vm running in Parallels,
* mac laptop
* Nix running in WSL 2 on my Gaming PC

This configuration is heavily based around using flakes and home manager

I mostly interact with it on nixos using `hey`, stolen from [hlissner](https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles). This config is also the inspiration for using agenix for secrets management. Other honorable mentions go to [Mitchell Hashimoto's nixos-config from which I've also stolen a lot :)](https://github.com/mitchellh/nixos-config).

Obviously this is always a WIP.
